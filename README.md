# ⚽ Segmenting and Classifying the Best Strikers

## 📖 Introduction
In football, strikers play a crucial role in determining match outcomes. This project analyzes a dataset of 500 strikers to uncover patterns, insights, and classify strikers based on their performance metrics and personal attributes. The goal is to help coaches, scouts, and analysts identify top-performing strikers.
